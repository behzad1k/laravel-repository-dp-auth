**Laravel repository design pattern with a rtl CMS by material dashboard ui** <br>
I added repository design pattern deployment along with access level.
**Deployment**
1.Pull the repo
2.Navigate to the directory in terminal
3.Install the dependencies:
`composer install`
4.Create the .env file:
`cp .env.example .env`
5.Customize the DB_DATABASE, DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD with your own info
6.Migrate and seed the tables:
`php artisan migrate --seed`
6.Run the project:
`php artisan serv`
Use the default user/pass : bhzd1k@gmail.com/secret to login or you can sign up with your own credentials!
